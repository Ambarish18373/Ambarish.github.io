   <h2>Football is one of the most popular games. Football is basically a combination of 'foot' & 'ball'.
American Football is usually called Rugby where as UK Football is called Soccer.

Soccer:
<i>Any of several games played between two teams on a usually rectangular field
having goalposts or goals at each end and whose object is to get the ball over a goal
line, into a goal, or between goalposts by running, passing, or kicking is Soccer.</i>
This is just a definition but football is much more than this.

In this website you will find important information about soccer
I will make a website on Rugby soon.
